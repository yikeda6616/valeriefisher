        <h2>Hi I'm Valerie</h2>
        <p>
          Fine art has constantly drawn my attention and I have always tried to find a way how to capture moments which surrounds me. I found it in photography. More than 7 years have passed by from first shoots on a smart phone to this day. Many things have changed during that time, but my passion has lived on. Passion for progress and joy of a good work and a positive feedback.        </p>
        <p>
          At this time I study photography in Prague. Thanks to that, I have opportunity to explore the Czech Republic and whole Europe. You can track my steps and experiences on my <a href="#">Instagram</a> and <a href="#">Facebook</a> pages.
